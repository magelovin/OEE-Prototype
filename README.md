This repository contains an OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) prototype in C# to analyze and measure the overall efficiency of equipment in production environments. I created this project with the intention of learning more about programming in C#.
The time production in this program to calculate is 480, if u want change, feel free to create a variavel to do it.
